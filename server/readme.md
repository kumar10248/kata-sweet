# Sweet Shop Management System

## Overview

This is a full-stack Sweet Shop Management System built as part of a technical assessment.
The application allows users to browse and purchase sweets, while administrators can manage
inventory through protected APIs. The project follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) for the backend
and a modern SPA architecture for the frontend.

## My AI Usage
## My AI Usage

### AI Tools Used
- ChatGPT (OpenAI)

### How I Used AI
I used ChatGPT and Copilot as a productivity and learning assistant during development. Specifically:
- To clarify backend architecture decisions and REST API design.
- To understand error messages and debugging strategies during development.
- To get guidance on best practices for Express.js, MongoDB, authentication, and authorization.
- To assist in structuring frontend components and managing API calls using Axios.
- To help write and refine documentation for the project.

All core logic, implementation decisions, and final code were written and reviewed by me.
AI-generated suggestions were used selectively and adapted to fit the project requirements.

### Reflection on AI Impact
Using AI significantly improved my development speed and helped me unblock issues faster,
especially during debugging and architectural planning. However, I treated AI as a supportive
tool rather than a replacement for understanding. I ensured that I fully understood every
piece of code added to the project and validated functionality through testing.

I believe AI, when used responsibly, enhances developer productivity while still requiring
strong foundational knowledge and critical thinking.
